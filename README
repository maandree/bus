A simple daemonless system for broadcasting messages locally.

bus uses a System V semaphore array and System V shared memory.
Buses are named; the key of the semaphore array and the
shared memory is stored in a regular file.

Communication over bus is synchronous. The broadcast call does
not return until all listeners have received (and copyied)
the message.

The software package contains a C library and a command line
utility. The package python-bus provides a Python 3 module.
