create:
	Select a filename.

	Create XSI semaphore array {S = 0, W = 0, X = 1, Q = 0 and N = 0}
	with random key. Store the semaphore array's key in decimal form
	on the first line in the selected file.

	Create XSI shared memory, with an allocation of 2048 bytes, with a
	random key. Store the shared memory's key in decimal form on the
	second line in the selected file.
