Use-case example.

This example shows how bus can be used in an init
system to provide "aggressivly" parallel startup
of daemons.


First of, run make to build this example.

To start the example run ./init. It will print in
red export-statement you may want to run i other
terminals. You will need to select at least one
daemon, for example you can run `./init d-ntp`.
The available pretend daemons are: d-network,
d-ntp and d-ssh.

When you are done run ./cleanup with BUS_INIT
exported with the value printed by ./init.
