API usage example

This example shows how to use timed operations.



First of, run make to build this example.

To start the example run ./init.
When you are done run ./cleanup.

Running instances of ./poll will wait for new messages
continuously, but with one second timeouts.

Running instances of ./read will read for ten seconds
then time out.

./poll, ./read, ./init and ./cleanup are run without any
additional arguments. ./write is run with the message
as the second argument.
