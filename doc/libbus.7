.TH LIBBUS 7 BUS-%VERSION%
.SH NAME
libbus - A simple daemonless system for broadcasting messages locally
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbus\fP is a stupid-simple, thrilless, daemonless interprocess
communication system for broadcasting messages.
.SH RATIONALE
We need an interprocess communication system similar to message queues.
But we need broadcasting rather than anycasting, so we have a fast,
simple and daemonless system for announcing events to any processes that
might be interested.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTION
Perhaps the ability to have groups and other permissions on bus, so they
can be shared among users and be system-wide.  Private and abstract
buses might be interesting too, as well as timed out read and writes.
