.TH BUS-CHMOD 1 BUS-%VERSION%
.SH NAME
bus chmod - Change permissions on a bus
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bus chmod
[--]
.IR permissions
.IR pathname
.SH DESCRIPTION
Change whom as access to a bus with an associated \fIpathname\fP.
In the \fIpermissions\fP, the owner, the group, and others (not
in group) are represented by the symbols \fBu\fP, \fBg\fP, and
\fBo\fP, respectively.  The \fIpermissions\fP string is imagined
to have always be prefixed with an \fB=\fP.  This symbols means
that all user classes list after it, and only those classes, as
permission to use the bus.  Similarly the symbols \fB+\fP and
\fB\-\fP can be used to grant and revoke access, respectively.
The symbols \fB=\fP, \fB+\fP, and \fB\-\fP can be maked, and are
interpreted from left to right.  Alternatively the \fIpermissions\fP
string can be a octal number, where the owner is represented by any
bit in 700 (100, 200, or 400, or any combination thereof), the
group is represented by any bit in 70, and others (not in the group)
is represented by any bit in 7.
